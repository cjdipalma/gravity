# The Gravity Compiler

The Gravity Compiler is an Artificial Neural Network to ANSI C optimizing
compiler intended for embedded applications. Specifically, the generated
ANSI C file is a self contained, dependency free, ANSI standard C file that
can be compiled to a target platform/architecture.

But there is more. The Gravity compiler has three modes of operation:
 * It can be used as a traditional compiler
 * It can be used as an embedded compiler
 * It can be used as a just-in-time compiler
